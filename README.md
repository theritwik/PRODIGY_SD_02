# Guessing Game

This Python program is an interactive guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high or too low. The game continues until the correct number is guessed, and the program displays the number of attempts made by the user.

## Features

- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Provides feedback after each guess (too high or too low).
- Tracks and displays the number of attempts once the correct number is guessed.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
3. Input your guesses one at a time.
4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Once you guess the correct number, the program will display how many attempts it took.

## Example

```bash
Welcome to the Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 45
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 70
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 60
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
